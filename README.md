# KontortOS
KontortOS aims at creating an extremely minimalist and clean UI interface, in an OS that requires very little system resources, and can be run on nearly any machine with no problems. The project only recently began, and, due to lack of knowledge in kernel development, has been built off linux. This however, is going to be changed, as a custom kernel, codenamed Kyron is going to be built, allowing for amazing feature. 
# Compatbility
KontortOS hopes to incorporate Windows compatibility, running a a custom yet similar version of Wine (https://www.winehq.org/). With this, running EXE applications should be extremely easy, allowing for many users to easily use this OS as their primary OS. 
# User Friendly
Unfortunately, in the direction the project seems to be heading, it won't be simple to setup and run, proving to be harder to set up then some odd distros of Linux. We hope to change this in the future, however, only time will tell.
# Assistance
We do not request you help us in this project. This is for your protection as well as our privacy and yours. Since the OS is fairly new, and won't be running on a pre-built kernel, it will be *extremely* vulnerable to hackers or viruses. The OS also is not stable and can cause irrevocable damage to any parts within the computer. As such, the doors to any downloads or pre-alpha builds are tightly shut. This decision may change, once the OS is partially more stable, or if we abandon *Kyron F*, but only time will truly tell.
# Information
Information regarding the development of the OS can be found on my website. The website is currently down due to some problems with our servers, however, in the meantime, this repository will be updated in regards to the project.

# Updates
## 8/2017
Project will be suspended indefinitely. We will attempt to work from RemixOS, a better port of android, with absolute *trash* compatibility with systems running graphics cards beyond Intel GPU. They also cant support anything but the intel 4th gen processor. We will attemptt to giove it better compatibility and breath into it, the life everyone hopes it can hold. This project will be updated
# VERY SOON
